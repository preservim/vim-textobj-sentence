> Improving on Vim's native sentence text object and motion

Detecting sentences can be tricky, esp. when the words and punctuation of
a sentence are interspersed with abbreviations, “quotations,”
(parentheses), [brackets], the \_\_markup\_\_ from \*\*lightweight\*\*
markup languages, and hard<br>line<br>breaks.

While Vim’s native sentence text object is quite capable, its behavior
remains hard-coded and cannot be extended. Thus arises the need for
a specialized text object offered by this plugin.

Features of this plugin:

* Sophisticated sentence text object, supporting selection, motion, and jump
* Implemented with regular expressions via the [vim-textobj-user][vt] plugin
* Supports sentences containing common abbreviations (configurable)
* Support for sentences containing typographical characters, incl. quotes, em dash, etc.
* Support for lightweight markup languages (markdown, e.g.)
* Buffer scoped configuration

## Requirements

May require a recent version of Vim.

## Installation

Install using Pathogen, Vundle, Neobundle, or your favorite Vim package
manager.

This plugin has an essential dependency that you will need to install:

* [kana/vim-textobj-user][vt] - a Vim plugin to create your own text objects without pain

## Configuration

Because prose benefits more than code from a sentence text object, the
behavior of this plugin can be configured per file type. For example, to
enable sentence  in `markdown` and `textile` files, place in your
`.vimrc`:

```vim
set nocompatible            " this may already be in your .vimrc
filetype plugin indent on   " ...and this too

augroup textobj_sentence
  autocmd!
  autocmd FileType markdown call textobj#sentence#init()
  autocmd FileType textile call textobj#sentence#init()
augroup END
```

### Decimal numbers and abbreviations

Though the period `.` glyph/character will normally terminate a sentence,
it also has other uses. For example, the same glyph is used in
abbreviations like  ‘M.D.’ for Medical Doctor. These abbreviations, however,
should be tolerated when detecting the boundaries of a sentence. The
following should be considered one text object, rather than four:

```
Magnum, P.I. lives at Robin’s Nest, located at 11435 18th Ave., Oahu, HI.
```

This plugin detects decimal numbers and common abbreviations. By default,
the following abbreviations will be recognized:

```
  let g:textobj#sentence#abbreviations = [
    \ '[ABCDIMPSUabcdegimpsv]',
    \ 'l[ab]', '[eRr]d', 'Ph', '[Ccp]l', '[Lli]n', '[cn]o',
    \ '[Oe]p', '[DJMSh]r', '[MVv]s', '[CFMPScfpw]t',
    \ 'alt', '[Ee]tc', 'div', 'es[pt]', '[Ll]td', 'min',
    \ '[MD]rs', '[Aa]pt', '[Aa]ve?', '[Ss]tr?',
    \ '[Aa]ssn', '[Bb]lvd', '[Dd]ept', 'incl', 'Inst', 'Prof', 'Univ',
    \ ]
```

Note that you can override/modify the above defaults in your `.vimrc`, but
be sure to include the declaration before your call to
`textobj#sentence#init()`.

### Motion commands

Motion commands on text objects are a powerful feature of Vim.

This plugin overrides Vim’s native commands for sentence selection:

* `as` - select ‘_around_’ sentence with trailing whitespace
* `is` - select ‘_inside_’ sentence without trailing whitespace

* `(` - move to start of previous sentence
* `)` - move to start of next sentence

This plugin adds:

* `g)` - jump to end of current sentence
* `g(` - jump to end of previous sentence

You can manipulate text just as with Vim’s original `as` and `is`
commands, such as `cis` for change, `vas` for visual selection, `das` for
deletion, `yas` for yanking to clipboard, etc.. Note that count isn’t
supported at present (due to limitations of the underlying
vim-textobj-user) but repeat with `.` does work.

If you prefer to retain the native commands, you can assign other
key mappings via your `.vimrc`:

  ```vim
  let g:textobj#sentence#select = 's'
  let g:textobj#sentence#move_p = '('
  let g:textobj#sentence#move_n = ')'
  ```
